# React + Vite

I developed a full-stack web application aimed at providing a comprehensive directory for all medical professionals in my city, including doctors, pharmacies, medical labs, and nursing services. The platform is designed to help users easily find healthcare providers based on their specific needs, such as specialty (e.g., ophthalmology), and allows them to interact with the providers through ratings and comments.



Key Features:



User Types:

Admin User: Admins have full control over the platform, including the ability to create, edit, and delete entries for doctors, pharmacies, medical labs, and nursing services.



Normal User: Users can search for healthcare providers, rate their services, and leave comments. Users can also filter providers based on specific specialties like ophthalmology or cardiology.



Backend Technologies:



Node.js & Express: For building a scalable and efficient backend API.

MongoDB: For flexible and efficient data storage.

Cloudinary: For managing image uploads (e.g., doctor profile pictures).



Frontend Technologies:



React.js: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Material-UI: For styling components with a clean, professional look.

Zod: For form validation and ensuring data consistency on the frontend.

Chart.js : For Charts in website.



This project showcases my expertise in full-stack development, leveraging modern technologies to build a user-friendly and scalable healthcare directory platform.
